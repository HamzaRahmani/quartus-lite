# quartus-lite

Quartus Lite docker.

For Mac OS X users, I included a `quartus_sh` shell script, which allows execution of quartus_sh inside the docker container. The current working directory is mounted to `/build`. The `quartus_sh` command is executed there. Just copy `quartus_sh` to a directory in your `PATH`.
